<h1>Problems I face in reading books</h1>

<h2>Problem - I lose track of my progress</h2>
I pick a book, I spend half hour or 45 mins and keep the book aside and it takes months if not years for me to pick the same book and as I read I feel like...This seems familiar. Where did I come across this information.

<h2>Problem - I don't complete reading books</h2>
This was another issue I faced. There were countless books I have started but I have not completed them.

<h2>Problem - I don't know what is the progress I am making. How long did it take for me to read this book?</h2>
This is another question that plagues me. I want to know how many days I have spent reading this book. Is it possible to figure out how much time I am spending reading this book?

<h2>Problem - I don't read that many books that I should</h2>
I want to me a literate man. I want to read a lot of books and I want to read quality books. But I found myself that I was making much progress.

<h1>Solution</h1>

<h2>Mark the Paragraph</h2>
I put a tick mark next to the para that I just finished reading.
This is simple, but very effective in many ways. I know what I have read, and I am leveraging cognitive dissonance. My mind is not going to rest till I see tick marks in all the paragraphs. This ensured that I read the book completely.
I have since then read a lot of books, and I have completely read them. Do I remember all of them - that is the subject of another article.

<h2>I date the page</h2>
After I read the page, I put the date and the time in the margin. This gives me feedback later on to know as to when I read the page.
