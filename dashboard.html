Hello World!!!

<h2>Tutorial - On The 3-Click System</h2>

<p>Need: With 3 clicks I want to find what I am looking for.<p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>

<p>Top down organization is done as follows:  Key Result Areas/Projects/Modules

<h3>Navigation and File layout</h3>

<p>Every folder will have an index.html to list the contents within the folder.
<p>an index.html in a Project will list all the Module names
<p>an index.html in a module will list all the file names

<p>Only a project will have a TODO.html file.

<p>Todo is organized as a Kanban Board.

<h3>Internals</h3>

<p>This uses Frames. There are 4 frames: kraFrame, projectFrame, moduleFrame and itemFrame.

That's it!!!! Lets go 3 clicking our way to productivity!!!
